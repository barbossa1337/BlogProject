                JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on
                web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for
                you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics,
                scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third
                layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in
                much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
                <br><br>
                JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated to JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
                technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript
                on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web
                browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
                <br><br>
                JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
                multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
                application
                programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
                structures,
                and the Document Object Model (DOM).
                <br><br>
                The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
                graphics
                facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
                <br><br>
                JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some
                servers
                and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
                <br><br>
                Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two
                languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

                HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies
                for building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for
                a variety of devices. Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and CSS are the basis of building Web
                pages and Web Applications.
                <br><br>
                HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior
                and
                content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
                Consortium
                (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use
                of
                CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display
                video and audio, primarily using the element, in collaboration with javascript.
                <br><br>
                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME
                type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
                validation service for CSS documents.
                <br><br>
                In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and
                XUL.

                React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your
                application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data
                changes.
                <br><br>
                Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
                <br><br>
                React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for
                building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a
                community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of
                single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is
                only
                concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications
                usually
                requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.
