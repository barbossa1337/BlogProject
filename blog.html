        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <img src="images/js.png" alt="Javascript" height="150px">
        <p>
            JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on
            web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for
            you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics,
            scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third
            layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in
            much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
            <br><br>
            JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated to JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
            technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript
            on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web
            browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
            <br><br>
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
            standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
            multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
            programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
            and the Document Object Model (DOM).
            <br><br>
            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
            facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
            <br><br>
            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers
            and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
            <br><br>
            Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two
            languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
        </p>
        <h2>HTML 5 & CSS 3</h2>
        <img src="images/html%20-%20css.jpg" alt="HTMl - CSS" height="150">
        <p>
            HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies
            for building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for
            a variety of devices. Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and CSS are the basis of building Web
            pages and Web Applications.
            <br><br>
            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
            content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium
            (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of
            CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display
            video and audio, primarily using the element, in collaboration with javascript.
            <br><br>
            The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME
            type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
            validation service for CSS documents.
            <br><br>
            In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
        </p>
        <h2>React JS</h2>
        <img src="images/reactJS.jpg" alt="React" height="150">
        <p>
            React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your
            application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data
            changes.
            <br><br>
            Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
            <br><br>
            React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for
            building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a
            community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of
            single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only
            concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually
            requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.
