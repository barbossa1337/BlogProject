            <p>
                JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on
                web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for
                you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics,
                scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third
                layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in
                much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area. <a href="blog.html">Click for more!</a>

            <p>
                HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies
                for building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for
                a variety of devices. Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and CSS are the basis of building Web
                pages and Web Applications. <a href="blog.html">Click for more!</a>

            <p>
                React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your
                application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data
                changes.

                Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug. <a href="blog.html">Click for

            <h2>What does a front-end developer do?</h2>
            <h3>Let's take a brief look...</h3>
            <p>A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—that is, the part
                that users actually see and interact with.</p>
            <img src="images/fe.png" alt="Front-end Developer" width="800px">
            <br>
            <blockquote>
                <q>Quoted from <strong>Coursera</strong>.</q>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                A <b>front-end developer</b> creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS,
                and
                JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website, the
                design elements you see were created by a front-end developer.
                <br><br>
                Contrast this with <b>back-end developers</b>, who work to develop the behind-the-scenes portions of a
                website
                or application, like data storage, security, site performance, or other server-side functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Front-end developers create the user interface (UI) that determines what each part of a site or
                application does and how it will look.
                <br><br>
                If someone wanted to build a website, for example, they might hire a front-end developer to create the
                site's layout. The front-end developer determines where to place images, what the navigation should look
                like, and how to present the site. Much of their work involves ensuring the appearance and layout of the
                site or application is easy to navigate and intuitive for the user.
                <br><br>
                "I've always found crafting polished user interactions that surprise and delight users to be the most
                rewarding and engaging task," says Mari Batilando, a software engineer at Meta. "In order to do this,
                you need to both have an eye for detail and a rock-solid understanding of the platform."

    <h3>Access Tokens</h3>
    <p>
        This one is really bad, but is really not that uncommon.
        <br><br>
        In JavaScript files, I’ve found the following:
    <ul>
        <li>AWS S3 id and secret key giving anyone full control over a S3 bucket</li>
        <li>Cloudinary credentials giving anyone full control over the bucket</li>
        <li>A CircleCI token, allowing me to launch builds, view commit history, and more</li>
        <li>Various other third party API keys</li>
    </ul>
    Those are often found in the admin / internal JS files. Developers may think these files won’t be served to
    regular users so it’s fine to put sensitive information inside, but more often that not, it’s easy to get access
    to those files.
